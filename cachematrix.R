## The following functions calculate the inverse of a matrix and saves it
## to the cache such that the next time the user attempts to calculate the
## matrix inverse, the previously saved value is returned instead of
## repeating the calculation.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object, which is really a list 
## containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  ## define the cache i
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y ## assign input matrix y to the variable x in parent environment
    i <<- NULL ## re-initialize i in the parent environment to null
  }
  get <- function() x ## return the matrix x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse ## set the cache i equal to the inverse of the matrix x
  getinverse <- function() i ## return the cached inverse of x
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created
## with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse
## has already been caclulated. If so, it 'get's the inverse from the cache
## and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the matrix inverse
## and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the 'setinverse' function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
        
}
